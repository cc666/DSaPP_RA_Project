    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Exploratory analysis\n",
    "1. The percentage of 'exciting' projects is 5.9%.\n",
    "2. Notice that the min values for 'donation_to_project' and 'donation_optional_support' are both negative. This is problematic as values in both fields should be non-negative. This might be due to errors in data recording.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A Data Story\n",
    "Are there common features shared by 'exciting' projects?\n",
    "By exploring 'projects.csv', I found that 'exciting' projects are 70% more likely to come from chartered schools than non-chartered ones. Also, 'exciting' projects are more likely to require 'Books' and 'Other' as resources among all resource types. However, there do not seem to be clear distinctions in the distribution of 'exciting' projects within each of these features: primary focus areas, poverty level of schools, average number of students reached, types of corporate offers, public magnet or not. For example, for each primary focus area, the percentage of 'exciting' projects is centered around 5.7% which is close to the percentage of exciting projects in the whole population (i.e. 5.9%)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Questions for the Project Partner\n",
    "1. I would like to confirm with my partner and find out why 'exciting' projects are 70% more likely to come from a chartered school than a non-chartered one. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. From the data given, the total number of students reached is calculated to be 64558408. This is about 20% of the 2016 figure of the total population in the US. This figure seems a little too big for me. I have already noticed some dubious figures like '999' or '999999' and I would like to work with my partner to cross check these figures, perhaps by using some other data sources or check with the schools where these figures belong to.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Models\n",
    "To further investigate relations between various features in projects.csv and whether a project is 'exciting', I used three models: logistic regression, support vector machine and random forest. In all three models, I treated the problem as a binary classification problem (where '0' refers to a project being not 'exciting' and '1' 'exciting'). I think a model that shows high accuracy in predicting '1' in the test data would be particularly useful. For example, it could be used to help us assess whether a project is 'exciting' or not based on features collected in 'projects.csv'. This piece of infomation can be useful for businesses and individual donors who are thinking of financing projects. Furthermore, I have looked at coefficients (in logistic regression and SVM) and feature importance scores (in random forest) that evaluate how important each feature is for the target variable ('exciting' or not).  \n",
    "\n",
    "From scores in the classification report, all three models gave similar performances. The accuracy in predicting '1' is around 60%. To improve the accuary, I would consider adding features from other data sources. For example, 'donations.csv' contains information on donated amount, donor's background etc which can be used in the predictive model. What could also be interesting but on a separate course is to understand the donation propensity of donors. To investigate this problem, we could analyse donors' messages from 'donation_message' in 'donations.csv'. We could for example use text summarisation methods to help us understand why donors donate and perhaps how that propensity differs between 'exciting' projects and non 'exciting' ones.        \n",
